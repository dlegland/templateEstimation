Definition: Shape is all the geometrical information that remains when location,
 scale and rotational effects are removed from an object.

Note that in many cases, it is not desirable to remove the scaling effect,
 that may be related to growth for instance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach suffers some drawbacks, notably the difficulty to precisely
 define the landmarks, and the need to interpolate between the landmarks
 (notion of semi-landmarks).
 The landmark are most of the time manually located, making this approach
 very time-consuming and error-prone for 3D structures or images.
 It is possible to propagate landmarks from existing models

Image registration and atlas creation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Image registration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Image registration consists on computing the deformation that best superimpose
 one image onto the other.
 A large litterature exists on this topic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 In particular, several points need attention:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the type of deformation one wants to consider
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the type of metric used to compare objects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the numerical scheme for solving the problem, using (mathematical) optimisation
 or minimisation of a functional.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Parametric deformations

A first approach to reduce the complexity of the search is to consider parametri

 by a vector of parameters.
 Several families of parametric models have been considered: polynomial,
 poly-affine...

\begin_layout Section
Geometric templates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The large deformation diffeomorphism framework originally devoted to atlas
 creation using 2D/3D grayscale images was later extended to manage geometric
 models such as point clouds or meshes.
 A critical point is to compute a distance between two objects, in particular
 for minimizing the distance between a template and an individual shape
 after transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In image-based registration, the metric is computed from the intensities
 (i.e.
 cross-correlation, mutual information...) or from the difference of label
 regions (dice coefficient, kappa-statistics...) of the two images.
 In the landmark-based approach, the question is simplified in the sense
 we need to compute distances between points.
 If we want to remove the necessity of homology between the points, the
 questions becomes more complicated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Currents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of current was developed as an extension of the work on diffeomorphis
ms applied to distributions.
 Application to distributions gives more flexibility in the sense we less
 depend on the representation of the data

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currents are an appropriate choice for representations of 3D surfaces because
 they inherit natural transformation properties from differential forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Varifolds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A subsequent approach is based on the notion of varifold 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The main difference is that the direction of the normals is not taken into
 account any more.
 This seems to facilitate the registration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Statistical settings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another strategy consists in embedding the atlas procedure into a statistical
 setting.
 Using a generative model, every shape can be interpreted as the sum between
 a deformation of the template and noise (Allassonnière et al., 2007).
\end_layout

 A dimensionality reduction is necessary to avoid over fitting.

\begin_layout Chapter
Shape representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several possibilities exist for representing shapes.
 This chapter tries to sketch a representative list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original data often come in the forme of 2D/3D images.
 Original intensity information is most of the time encoded into gray levels.
 Segmentation algorihtms may produce binaty images, or more generally label
 maps, in which the (integer) value of the pixel/voxel corresponds to the
 index of the structure it belongs to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Point clouds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest and the most generic method to represent shapes is a set of
 points distributed across the boundary.
 Such boundary points can be extracted after image segmentation algorithms
 or using algorithms such as the Marching Cubes.
 The shapes can be called point sets, point clouds...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Landmarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most works on template construction are historically based on the manual
 determination of landmarks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Bookstein_1991_book,Cootes_1992_bmvc"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 At the difference of (unordered) point clouds, landmarks are associated
 to a specific anatomic position, usually a corner or the extremity of a
 curve.
 To gain precision for the registration of 2D or 3D curves, semi-landmarks
 can be determiend by equally spacing landmarks on the curve between two

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Polygons and meshes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It may be desirable to consider also the connectivity between the points.
 In 2D, connectivity can be represented by ordered list of vertices, resulting
 in polygons or polylines.
 In 3D, connectivity is often represented by a set of polygonal faces, usually
 triangular.
 This results on polygonal or triangular meshes.

Currents and varifolds
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "subsec:Currents"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notion of current was developed as an extension of the work on diffeomorphis
ms applied to distributions.
 Currents correspond to a collection of points associated to an oriented
 normal.
 Typically, the points and the normal can be otbained from the centroid
 and the normal of the faces of a (triangular ) mesh.
 Currents are an appropriate choice for representations of 3D surfaces because
 they inherit natural transformation properties from differential forms.

\begin_layout Section
Shape Complexes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some authors coin the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

shape complex
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to consider the set of all surfaces obtained after segmentation of an individua
l subject.
 Shape complexes can be composed of curves and surfaces.
 Both can be modeled via varifolds (section

).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Medial axes or skeleton can be used to represent shapes.
 Their manipulation is however not easy.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 the zero-crossing of a function.
 In particular, the level-set approach uses this representation in the context
